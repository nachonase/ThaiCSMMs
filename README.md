**Overview**   
This repository is for modeling dietâ€“gut microbiome interactions based on Thai adult microbiome profiles.  
The pipeline simulates microbial metabolic activity under Thai dietary and prebiotic conditions.  

The modeling workflow consists of three parts:  
1. Reconstruction and modeling of Thai community-scale metabolic models (CSMMs) using an average Thai diet  
2. Prediction of microbial contributions to SCFA production  
3. Simulation of prebiotic responses and uptake flux analysis  

**Installation**  
Install MATLAB (tested with R2024a).  
Install COBRA Toolbox  

**Usage**  
Run the main pipeline in main.m

**Supplementary folders**
1. ThaiDietData: data in this folder are used for calculating the average Thai diet.
2. Codes: this foldar contains in-house MATLAB scripts developed and used for data preprocessing.
3. AGORAmodels: this folder is used as modPath for reconstructing CSMMs.
