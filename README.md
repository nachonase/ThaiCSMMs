**Overview**   
This repository is for modeling dietâ€“gut microbiome interactions based on Thai adult microbiome profiles.  
The pipeline simulates microbial metabolic activity under Thai dietary and prebiotic conditions.  

The modeling workflow consists of three parts:  
1. Reconstruction and modeling of Thai community-scale metabolic models (CSMMs) using an average Thai diet  
2. Prediction of microbial contributions to SCFA production  
3. Simulation of prebiotic responses and uptake flux analysis  

**Installation**  
Install MATLAB (tested with R2024a).  
Install COBRA Toolbox  

**Usage**  
Run the main pipeline in main.m

**Supplementary folders**
1. ThaiDietData: data in this folder are used for calculating the average Thai diet.
2. Codes: this foldar contains in-house MATLAB scripts developed and used for data preprocessing.
3. AGORAmodels: This folder serves as the modPath for reconstructing CSMMs. Because the full model set is large, I have uploaded only some AGORA models used in my study as examples. Please download the remaining AGORA models from Google Drive: https://shorturl.at/7hySD . After downloading, place the AGORA .mat files into the AGORA_1_03_mat folder.
4. BackupThaiCSMMs: This folder contains all 86 Thai CSMM .mat files generated in this study (Step 1 results).
