**Overview** 
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for modeling dietâ€“gut microbiome interactions based on Thai adult microbiota profiles.
The pipeline simulates microbial metabolic activity under different dietary scenarios and prebiotic interventions.

The modeling workflow consists of three parts:
1. Reconstruction and modeling of Thai GMiMs using an average Thai diet
2. Prediction of microbial contributions to SCFA production
3. Simulation of prebiotic responses and uptake flux analysis

**Installation**
Install MATLAB (tested with R2024a).
Install COBRA Toolbox

**Usage**
Run the main pipeline in main.m
